1
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,269
Millions of years ago...

2
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,102
a meteorite made of vibranium...

3
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,805
the strongest substance
in the universe...

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,512
struck the continent of Africa...

5
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,790
affecting the plant life around it.

6
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,863
And when the time of men came...

7
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:57,748
five tribes settled on
it and called it...

8
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,629
Wakanda.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,543
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other

10
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,492
until a warrior shaman

11
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:09,597
received a vision from
the panther goddess Bast

12
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,177
who led him to the
heart-shaped herb.

13
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:16,771
A plant that granted him
superhuman strength,

14
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:19,471
speed and instincts.

15
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,035
The warrior became king...

16
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:23,412
and the first Black Panther.

17
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:26,202
The protector of Wakanda.

18
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,189
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule.

19
00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:33,922
But the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

20
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:38,004
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology

21
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:41,220
more advanced than
any other nation.

22
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,051
But as Wakanda thrived,

23
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:46,575
the world around it
descended further into chaos.

24
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,942
To keep vibranium safe,

25
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:55,375
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

26
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,695
keeping the truth of their
power from the outside world.

27
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,356
-Lucky shot!
-That ain't lucky!

28
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,948
-Whatever!
-Get outta here!

29
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,413
Check up. No dirties.

30
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,138
What?

31
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,742
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

32
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:31,100
Got you, E!

33
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:32,925
Watch me get this...

34
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,737
Tim Hardaway style. That's
what I call it, baby.

35
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,913
Hey, look, if we get in and out
quick, won't be no worries.

36
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,252
You're in the van, come
in through from the west.

37
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,465
Come around the corner.

38
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,878
-Land right here.
-Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,519
Me and the twins
pullin' up right here.

40
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:50,849
We're leaving this car behind, okay?
We come this...

41
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,542
Hide the straps.

42
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,460
Yo, is it the feds?

43
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:10,352
No.

44
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:25,230
These two Grace Jones
lookin' chicks.

45
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,052
They own spears.

46
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,492
Open it.

47
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,388
You serious?

48
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:32,757
They won't knock again.

49
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,277
Who are you?

50
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,587
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

51
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:57,922
Show me you're one of us.

52
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,473
My King.

53
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,544
Leave us.

54
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:13,716
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays.

55
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,978
With your permission,
King T'Chaka.

56
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,307
As you wish.

57
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,655
At ease.

58
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,498
Come, brother.

59
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,811
Let me see how you're
holding up.

60
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,275
You look strong.

61
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:46,297
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

62
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,877
How's home?

63
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,558
Not so good.

64
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,355
Little brother.

65
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,311
There has been an attack.

66
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,832
This man...

67
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:00,430
Ulysses Klaue...

68
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,956
stole a quarter ton
of vibranium from us

69
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,503
and triggered a bomb at
the border to escape.

70
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,764
Many lives were lost.

71
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,758
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

72
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,549
and how to strike.

73
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,393
He had someone on the inside.

74
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,369
Why are you here?

75
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,736
Because I want you to
look me in the eyes...

76
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:25,982
and tell me why
you betrayed Wakanda.

77
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,533
I did no such thing.

78
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,353
Tell him who you are.

79
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,117
Zuri, son of Badu.

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,314
What?

81
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:42,877
James.

82
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,448
James, you lied to me?

83
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:45,834
-Leave him be.
-I let you into my home...

84
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,128
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

85
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,736
-You betrayed Wakanda!
-How can you lie to me?

86
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,873
Stand!

87
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,341
Down.

88
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:57,546
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

89
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,537
Prince N'Jobu,

90
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,679
you will return home at once...

91
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,433
where you will face the Council

92
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,191
and inform them of your crimes.

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,710
Look up!

94
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,222
Guard your man, guard your man!

95
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,726
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death</i>

96
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:22,872
<i>of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

97
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,649
<i>The beloved ruler was one
of many confirmed dead</i>

98
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:28,518
<i>after a terrorist attack at the
United Nations a week ago.</i>

99
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:31,374
<i>The suspect has since
been apprehended.</i>

100
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,369
<i>Though it remains one of the
poorest countries in the world,</i>

101
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,325
<i>fortified by mountain ranges</i>

102
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:38,310
<i>and an impenetrable rain forest,</i>

103
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:41,485
<i>Wakanda does not engage
in international trade</i>

104
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,993
<i>or accept aid.</i>

105
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:44,474
<i>The succession of the throne</i>

106
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:47,159
<i>is expected to fall to the oldest
of the king's two children,</i>

107
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,577
<i>Prince T'Challa.</i>

108
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,264
My prince...

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,304
Coming up on them now.

110
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,020
Sambisa Forest, Nigeria

111
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:18,387
No need, Okoye. I can
handle this alone.

112
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:20,411
Hmm.

113
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,458
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

114
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,828
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

115
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,650
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:38,142
I never freeze.

117
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,440
What's going on?

118
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,068
Lost power.

119
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:58,662
Won't start.

120
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,667
The car not start.

121
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:02,381
What happened?

122
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,850
The engine's failed.

123
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,463
Ours too.

124
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,315
What is it, Captain?

125
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:22,389
Defense positions.

126
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:24,406
Defense positions.

127
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,261
Are we under attack?

128
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,907
Defense positions.

129
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,817
N'jou! Get around to the side.

130
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,316
Defense positions.

131
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,893
Hey! Defense positions!

132
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,853
No games.

133
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,632
What do you see?

134
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,461
Come in. Come in.

135
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,754
-Over there!
-Look back!

136
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:17,273
Watch out!

137
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:44,515
T'Challa, no!

138
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:46,175
This one's just a boy.

139
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,981
He got kidnapped as well.

140
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,235
Nakia...

141
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,560
I...

142
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,188
-I wanted...
-Hey!

143
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,096
I have her! Don't move!
I will shoot!

144
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,139
I will shoot her right--

145
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,177
You froze.

146
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,397
Ah.

147
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,959
Why are you here?
You ruined my mission.

148
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:24,533
My father is dead, Nakia.

149
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,791
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

150
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,454
And I wish for you
to be there.

151
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,035
Carry yourselves home now.

152
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,892
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

153
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:44,297
Thank you.

154
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,378
You will speak
nothing of this day.

155
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:54,753
Yes.

156
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:56,651
Thank you.

157
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:58,508
Thank you.

158
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,370
Sister Nakia...

159
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,319
my Prince...

160
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:38,675
we are in home.

161
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,189
This never gets old.

162
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:11,248
Queen Mother...

163
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:13,002
Princess...

164
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:15,131
A comfort for your loss.

165
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:16,520
Thank you, Nakia.

166
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:19,716
It is so good to have
you back with us.

167
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,877
Take her to the River Province
to prepare her for the ceremony.

168
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:24,020
Yes, General.

169
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,925
Did he freeze?

170
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:37,053
Like an antelope in headlights.

171
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,930
You finished?

172
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:46,513
So surprised my little
sister came to see me off

173
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:48,196
before our big day.

174
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:49,004
You wish.

175
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,748
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

176
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,317
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

177
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,697
How many times do
I have to teach you?

178
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,420
Just because something works

179
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,171
doesn't mean that
it cannot be improved.

180
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:02,125
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

181
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,394
More than you.

182
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:06,708
I can't wait to see what
kind of update you make

183
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:08,948
to your ceremonial outfit.

184
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:11,433
Shuri!

185
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,204
Sorry, Mother!

186
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:15,755
How are you feeling today,
Mother?

187
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,142
Proud.

188
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:21,773
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

189
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,457
He is with us...

190
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,758
and it is your time to be king.

191
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,631
London, United Kingdom

192
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,598
Good Morning.

193
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:51,117
How can I help you?

194
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,003
Oh, just checking out
these artifacts.

195
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,392
They tell me you're the expert.

196
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,679
Ah, you  could say that.

197
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,590
They're beautiful.

198
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,132
Where is this one from?

199
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,911
The Bobo Ashanti tribe.

200
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,406
Present day Ghana,
nineteenth century.

201
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,715
For real?

202
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,563
And what about this one?

203
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,898
That one's from the
Edo people of Benin,

204
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:17,372
sixteenth century.

205
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,492
Now, tell me about this one.

206
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:27,659
Also from Benin, seventh century.

207
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:30,096
Fula tribe, I believe.

208
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:32,021
Nah.

209
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:33,990
I beg your pardon?

210
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:35,951
It was taken by British
soldiers in Benin,

211
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,451
but it's from Wakanda.

212
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,438
And it's made out of vibranium.

213
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,305
Don't trip. I'ma take it
off your hands for you.

214
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,727
These items aren't for sale.

215
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:50,525
How do you think your
ancestors got these?

216
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,068
You think they
paid a fair price?

217
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,721
Or did they take it, like
they took everything else?

218
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,101
Sir, I'm going to have to...
ask you to leave.

219
00:16:58,214 --> 00:17:01,516
You got all this security in here
watching me ever since I walked in.

220
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:04,153
But you ain't checking for
what you put in your body.

221
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,224
All right, mate, let's have it
Come on, mate, time.

222
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,637
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

223
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,912
Hey! Somebody get some help!
Come here!

224
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,355
Call the doctor, please!

225
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:14,602
Hey, please, somebody come help!

226
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:15,623
Medical emergency
right away in the

227
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,694
West African exhibit,
please, right away.

228
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:18,795
Watch out.

229
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,145
Step back, please. Step back.

230
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:24,820
Ho! Medics coming.

231
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,772
I'm gonna take a break.

232
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:32,335
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

233
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,843
Step back, please, gents.
Step back, please.

234
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,405
Hey, come here.

235
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:42,078
Come here, come here.

236
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,468
It's okay.

237
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:47,542
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

238
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:55,372
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

239
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:58,242
Because it's better to leave the
crime scene more spread out.

240
00:17:58,306 --> 00:17:59,970
Makes it look like amateurs.

241
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,799
Now then, let's see if you know
what you're talking about.

242
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,664
That's just a taste.

243
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,709
-You're gonna be rich, boy.
-You better sell that quick.

244
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,197
It's already sold.

245
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,853
Whatever you try, the Wakandans
will probably show up.

246
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,441
Well, that'll make my day.

247
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:56,013
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

248
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,551
You're not telling me
that's vibranium too?

249
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,428
Nah, I'm just feelin' it.

250
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,070
Ahead!

251
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:45,470
Ahead!

252
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,491
I, Zuri,

253
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:07,381
son of Badu...

254
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:09,191
give to you...

255
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,423
Prince T'Challa...

256
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,579
The Black Panther!

257
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,820
The Prince...

258
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,559
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther

259
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:27,018
stripped away.

260
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,789
Glory to the ancestors.

261
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,235
Glory to the ancestors.

262
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:06,510
Victory in ritual combat...

263
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:10,397
comes by yield or death.

264
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,005
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior,

265
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:16,336
I now offer...

266
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,584
a path to the throne.

267
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:28,164
The Merchant Tribe will
not challenge today.

268
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:33,924
The Border Tribe will
not challenge today.

269
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,742
The River Tribe will
not challenge today.

270
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:44,586
The Mining Tribe will
not challenge today.

271
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,358
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

272
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,072
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

273
00:22:55,618 --> 00:22:58,415
This corset is really
uncomfortable.

274
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:01,759
So, could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

275
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,450
Mother!

276
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,290
Hey.

277
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:30,677
-Are they Jabari?
-Yes.

278
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:42,322
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:46,171
It's challenge day.

280
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:53,364
We have watched...

281
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:56,181
and listened from the mountains!

282
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,384
We have watched with disgust,

283
00:23:58,463 --> 00:24:01,351
as your technological
advancements

284
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:03,928
have been overseen by a child!

285
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,311
Who scoffs at tradition!

286
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:15,482
And now you want to hand the
nation over to this prince...

287
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:21,182
who could not keep
his own father safe.

288
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:24,653
Hmm?

289
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,850
We will not have it.

290
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:32,066
I say, we will not have it!

291
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:35,768
I, M'Baku...

292
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:38,125
leader of the Jabari...

293
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,522
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

294
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,731
Glory to Hanuman.

295
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:05,081
Jabari!

296
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:07,969
Dora Milaje!

297
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:09,303
Ahead!

298
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,914
Let the challenge begin!

299
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:31,432
Oh!

300
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:35,560
Stand up!

301
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:46,345
Come!

302
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:56,430
T'Challa!

303
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,061
Where is your god now?

304
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:13,757
Hey!

305
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:14,788
Yes!

306
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,236
No powers!

307
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:25,859
No claws!

308
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,000
No special suit!

309
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:32,073
Just a boy, not fit to lead!

310
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:35,326
Show him who you are!

311
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:53,626
I am Prince T'Challa!

312
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:55,636
Son of King T'Chaka!

313
00:26:55,803 --> 00:26:57,230
You can do this, T'Challa!

314
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:11,871
Yes!

315
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,414
Come on!

316
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:15,715
Yield! Don't make me kill you!

317
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,580
I would rather die!

318
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:21,845
T'Challa!

319
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:24,034
T'Challa!

320
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:25,853
T'Challa!

321
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,279
T'Challa!

322
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:30,046
T'Challa!

323
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:31,428
You have fought with honor!

324
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:32,607
Now yield!

325
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,933
Your people need you.

326
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:36,241
T'Challa!

327
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,385
Yield, man!

328
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,754
T'Challa!

329
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:40,754
T'Challa!

330
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,370
Yes!

331
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:44,974
Yes!

332
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,443
He-he-hey!

333
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,698
I now present to you,

334
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:11,575
King T'Challa!

335
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:15,730
The Black Panther.

336
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,010
Zuri.

337
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:24,996
My King.

338
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:37,288
Wakanda forever!

339
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,611
Wakanda forever!

340
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:13,945
Allow the heart-shaped herb

341
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:17,437
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

342
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,052
and take the Ancestral Plane.

343
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,729
T'Chaka...

344
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:28,815
we call on you.

345
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:31,761
Come here to your son.

346
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,077
Glory to the ancestors.

347
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,458
Father.

348
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:17,948
My son.

349
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:28,885
I am sorry.

350
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,049
Stand up.

351
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,275
You are a king.

352
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,082
What's wrong, son?

353
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:52,776
I am not ready.

354
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,067
Have you not prepared...

355
00:31:56,237 --> 00:32:00,502
your whole life to be king?

356
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:04,099
Have you not trained
and studied...

357
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:07,220
always by my side?

358
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:11,939
That is not what
I am talking about.

359
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:18,588
I am not ready to be without you.

360
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:24,545
A man who has not prepared
his children for his own death

361
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,819
has failed as a father.

362
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:29,913
Have I ever failed you?

363
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:31,554
Never.

364
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,170
Tell me how to best
protect Wakanda.

365
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:44,585
I want to be a great king, Baba.

366
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,606
Just like you.

367
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:49,992
You're going to struggle.

368
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:53,996
So you'll need to surround
yourself with people you trust.

369
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,956
You're a good man

370
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:58,051
with a good heart.

371
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:01,457
And it's hard for a good man
to be king.

372
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:06,676
Breathe.

373
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:10,616
T'Challa, breathe.

374
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:12,587
Breathe.

375
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:15,145
He was there.

376
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,285
He was there.

377
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,174
My father.

378
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:37,021
Just one.

379
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,564
Come home, Nakia.

380
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,828
I'm right here.

381
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:48,121
Stay.

382
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,095
I came to support you

383
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,603
and to honor your father.

384
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,294
But I can't stay.

385
00:33:55,156 --> 00:33:58,347
It's just, I found my
calling out there.

386
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:01,770
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

387
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,625
I can't be happy here

388
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:07,053
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

389
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:11,020
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

390
00:34:11,143 --> 00:34:12,752
Share what we have.

391
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,247
We could provide aid
and access to technology

392
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,596
and refuge to those who need it.

393
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:20,112
Other countries do it,
we could it do better.

394
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:24,410
We are not alike,
these countries, Nakia.

395
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,636
If the world found out
what we truly are...

396
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,004
what we possess,

397
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,707
we could lose our way of life.

398
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:33,102
Wakanda is strong
enough to help others

399
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,364
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

400
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:40,083
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

401
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,717
I would make a great queen
<i>because</i> I am so stubborn.

402
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:45,958
-Ah, see, you admit it!
-If...if that's what I wanted.

403
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:54,905
Is that him?

404
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:57,076
Hoo!

405
00:34:57,242 --> 00:35:00,822
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

406
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:02,564
Of course.

407
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,515
I see Nakia is back.

408
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:08,950
You guys going to work it out?

409
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:15,898
T'Challa...

410
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:17,601
What's wrong?

411
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:19,744
Nakia thinks we
should be doing more.

412
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:20,826
More like what?

413
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:23,501
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

414
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,571
You let the refugees in,

415
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,748
they bring their
problems with them.

416
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:30,377
And then Wakanda is
like everywhere else.

417
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:35,590
Now if you said you
wanted me and my men...

418
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:39,432
to go out there and clean out
the world, then I'll be all for it.

419
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:43,563
But waging war on other countries
has never been our way.

420
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:49,080
You too, huh?

421
00:35:49,257 --> 00:35:51,161
Bast! We're in trouble.

422
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,209
My King.

423
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
My love.

424
00:35:57,501 --> 00:36:01,177
You will never guess who
just popped up on our radar.

425
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,194
A misidentified Wakandan artifact

426
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:09,432
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

427
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:13,619
We have learned Ulysses Klaue

428
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,558
plans to sell the vibranium

429
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:17,762
to an American buyer
in South Korea

430
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,307
tomorrow night.

431
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:25,514
Klaue has escaped our
pursuits for almost 30 years.

432
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:29,785
Not capturing him is perhaps
my father's greatest regret.

433
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:32,733
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

434
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,837
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

435
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,254
We need a king.

436
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:42,103
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

437
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:45,253
Not a day goes by when
I do not think about

438
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:47,119
what Klaue took from us.

439
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:49,601
From me.

440
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:52,496
It's too great an
opportunity to pass.

441
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,645
Take me with you.

442
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,915
We'll take him down
together side by side.

443
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:59,064
I need you here
protecting the border.

444
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:00,583
Then I ask...

445
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,813
do you kill him
where he stands...

446
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:05,220
or you bring him back to us?

447
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,515
You have my word.

448
00:37:09,054 --> 00:37:11,155
I will bring him back.

449
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,700
We will proceed with the mission.

450
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,818
My King!

451
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:03,850
Stop it. Stop it.

452
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:09,162
I've already sent a car
ahead to Busan for you.

453
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,489
Who are you taking
with you to Korea?

454
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:13,171
Okoye.

455
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,452
And Nakia as well.

456
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:21,235
You sure it's a good idea to
take your ex on a mission?

457
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,671
Yes.

458
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:27,072
We'll be fine. Besides, you'll be
on call should we need backup.

459
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:27,973
Yes!

460
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,495
I have great things
to show you, brother.

461
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,782
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

462
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:38,669
Unlimited range, also equipped
with audio surveillance system.

463
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,240
Check these out.

464
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:44,485
Remote access Kimoyo beads.

465
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:47,579
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

466
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:48,563
Ah.

467
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,405
And what are these?

468
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:54,602
The real question is
what are those?!

469
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:56,848
Why do you have your
toes out in my lab?

470
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,118
What? You don't like
my royal sandals?

471
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:02,082
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

472
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:04,279
Yeah, I bet the elders loved it.

473
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,248
Try them on.

474
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:11,833
Fully automated.

475
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:14,420
Like the old American
movie Baba used to watch.

476
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:15,127
Mmm.

477
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:17,984
And I made them completely
sound absorbent.

478
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:20,719
Interesting.

479
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:22,219
Guess what I call them.

480
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:24,109
Sneakers.

481
00:39:25,817 --> 00:39:26,918
Because you...

482
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,373
Never mind.

483
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:31,119
If you're going to
take on Klaue,

484
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:35,319
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

485
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,979
Exhibit A.

486
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,789
-My design.
-Old tech.

487
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,250
-Old?
-Functional, but old.

488
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:45,220
"Hey, people are shooting me.
Wait, let me put on my helmet."

489
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:46,625
Enough.

490
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:50,067
Now, look at these.

491
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,481
Do you like that one?

492
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:54,988
Tempting.

493
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:58,336
But the idea is
to not be noticed.

494
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,905
This one.

495
00:40:08,091 --> 00:40:09,734
Now tell it to go on.

496
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:16,447
Whoo!

497
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:20,654
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

498
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,611
Strike it.

499
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:25,228
-Anywhere?
-Mm-hmm.

500
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:30,131
Not that hard, genius!

501
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:32,823
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

502
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:35,818
I invite you to my lab, and
you just kick things around?

503
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:38,169
Well, maybe you should
make it a little stronger.

504
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:39,466
Hey...

505
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:41,136
Wait a minute.

506
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,774
The nanites absorb
the kinetic energy

507
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:46,504
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

508
00:40:46,951 --> 00:40:48,150
Very nice.

509
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,089
Strike it again
in the same spot.

510
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:55,071
You're recording?

511
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:57,715
For research purposes.

512
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:06,291
Delete that footage.

513
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:10,396
Busan, South Korea

514
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:27,695
This way.

515
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:32,212
Bast willing, this will go quickly

516
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:35,308
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

517
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,944
It looks nice. Just
whip it back and forth.

518
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:41,706
What? It's a disgrace.

519
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:45,193
Hello, Sophia.

520
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:47,656
Nice to see you.

521
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:50,523
Who are those two?

522
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,397
My friends from Kenya.
Very wealthy. They're good.

523
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:58,205
Good for causing trouble...

524
00:41:58,402 --> 00:41:59,943
like you?

525
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:10,287
Thank you.

526
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,350
Spread out.

527
00:42:34,557 --> 00:42:37,182
The buyer is likely
already here.

528
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,371

529
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:42,111

532
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:56,553
The woman outside.

533
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,823
What "trouble" was
she referring to?

534
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:04,420
Ah. I got into a disagreement
with some ivory traders.

535
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,722
-Made a bit of a mess.
-Hm.

536
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:10,993
And will there be any trouble
tonight, Miss Kenyan Heiress?

537
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:12,261
It depends...

538
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:14,533
on how quickly
we finish the mission.

539
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:16,885
Can we please focus?

540
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,644
Thank you.

541
00:43:20,718 --> 00:43:22,067
Here.

542
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:24,735
Glass of whiskey.

543
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,695
Eyes up.

544
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:38,561
Americans.

545
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,404
I count three.

546
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,455
Five.

547
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:49,236
How could you miss Grease
Lightning there behind you?

548
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:50,452
Six.

549
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:54,114
I just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

550
00:43:54,274 --> 00:43:56,807
It just got a little
more complicated.

551
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,465
Agent Ross.

552
00:44:01,564 --> 00:44:02,672
Your Highness.

553
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,258
You are buying from Klaue?

554
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,521
What I'm doing or not doing

555
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:11,233
on behalf of the U.S. government
is none of your concern.

556
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:13,108
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

557
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:15,245
Do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

558
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,841
I gave you Zemo.

559
00:44:16,983 --> 00:44:18,308
Didn't I keep it under wraps?

560
00:44:18,432 --> 00:44:20,096
That the king of the
third world country

561
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:22,153
runs around in a
bulletproof cat suit?

562
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:23,685
I'd say we were even.

563
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,804
You really need to leave, now.

564
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:29,844
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

565
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:32,156
You've been warned.

566
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:35,218
Three, craps.

567
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:36,916
Hey, you won!

568
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:39,789
You know what?

569
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:42,143
I think I'll just take these,

570
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:43,872
bring 'em over here

571
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:46,634
-and hold on for safekeeping.
-Mm-hmm.

572
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:51,878
Okay, heads up.
The King of Wakanda is here.

573
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:53,812
He cannot leave with Klaue.

574
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:56,382
All right.

575
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,279
Vibranium from the attack on
Sokovia links back to a person

576
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:02,075
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make a deal with.

577
00:45:02,186 --> 00:45:03,846
But that deal will
not be called off.

578
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,292
When the dust settles,

579
00:45:05,356 --> 00:45:06,936
you and me can work
something out.

580
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:08,986
I'm not here to make a deal.

581
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:38,047
Klaue, plus eight.

582
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,250
General.

583
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:41,408
In position to secure our exit.

584
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:42,441
And the vibranium?

585
00:45:42,564 --> 00:45:44,114
I don't see it yet.

586
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:46,984
I thought there were no
weapons allowed in here.

587
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:48,793
There's not supposed to be.

588
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:51,403
Somebody did not get the memo.

589
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:54,007
Definitely armed.

590
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:56,685
Well, that is quite the entourage.

591
00:45:56,752 --> 00:45:57,992
You got a mix tape coming out?

592
00:45:58,176 --> 00:46:00,762
Uh, yeah, yeah,
actually, there is one.

593
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,898
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

594
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:04,272
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the...?

595
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:06,393
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

596
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:08,250
I just meant you got
a lot of people with you.

597
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:11,016
You think they're for you?

598
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,692
Do not worry.

599
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:16,277
I can do a deal with you all by
myself, thank you very much.

600
00:46:23,456 --> 00:46:25,924
Six more. It's a set up.

601
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,540
You got the diamonds?

602
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:30,764
I think that's enough.

603
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,486
-We need to move on Klaue.
-Stand down.

604
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,251
We can't afford a shootout.

605
00:46:37,388 --> 00:46:38,468
Vibranium?

606
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:50,591
Well, I was going to buy a
fancy suitcase, but I...

607
00:46:50,757 --> 00:46:52,542
thought I'd save
myself some money.

608
00:46:53,012 --> 00:46:54,589
It's now or never.

609
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:55,857
Don't!

610
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,584
Hey!

611
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:01,433
I've been made.

612
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,933
Wakandans! They're here!

613
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:16,504
-Get out of here!
-Kill them all!

614
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:19,776
Diamonds, quick!

615
00:48:16,575 --> 00:48:17,630
Assassin!

616
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:23,658
You know,

617
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,430
you look just like your old man.

618
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,414
I made it rain!

619
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:39,969
Let's get out of here, boss!

620
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,323
That was awesome!

621
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:46,807
It was awesome!

622
00:48:46,934 --> 00:48:48,978
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

623
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:53,760
-Do we just leave him?
-He'll catch up.

624
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:03,214
Shuri!

625
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:07,908
Yes! Yes! Yes!

626
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:10,353
<i>Remote driving system activated.</i>

627
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:12,874
Wait! Which side
of the road is it?

628
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:14,589
For Bast's sake, just drive!

629
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,787
Okay, calm down.

630
00:49:23,758 --> 00:49:25,408
Whoo! Let's go!

631
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:28,274
Put some music on. What do
you think this is, a funeral?

632
00:49:31,564 --> 00:49:33,196
What one is he in now?

633
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:36,643
Hey, split up!

634
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:40,169
-They're trying to lose us.
-I'll take the right.

635
00:49:42,294 --> 00:49:44,889
We'll take the other two.
I see a shortcut.

636
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:02,288
I'm not going to make it!

637
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:04,787
Keep going!

638
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:12,972
Oh! Brother!

639
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,910
Hey, what was that?

640
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,998
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

641
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,635
Guns.

642
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:41,119
So primitive.

643
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,090
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!

644
00:50:43,224 --> 00:50:44,779
The bullets won't penetrate!

645
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:47,668
What are you doing?

646
00:50:47,788 --> 00:50:48,922
Just drive.

647
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:54,400
Jeesh!

648
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:06,361
Whoo!

649
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:07,462
Oh, shit!

650
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:09,725
♪ Opps on the radar ♪

651
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,077
Hey, look at your suit.

652
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:25,344
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up with kinetic energy.

653
00:51:27,223 --> 00:51:28,557
Pull around the truck.

654
00:51:33,334 --> 00:51:34,400
Where'd he go?

655
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:45,221
You show off!

656
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:47,498
There he is!

657
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:50,933
Hold tight!

658
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:55,927
All right, let's have some fun.

659
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,099
Hop in.

660
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:27,977
Put that spear in the trunk.

661
00:52:33,264 --> 00:52:34,330
Faster, Shuri.

662
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:36,096
I'm going as fast as I can!

663
00:52:37,816 --> 00:52:39,073
Take a right! Take a right!

664
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:44,749
No, no, no, no, no!

665
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:48,276
Brother!

666
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,730
Klaue!

667
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,287
Did you think we would forget?

668
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:27,584
Look at me, murderer!

669
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:29,894
Where did you get this weapon?

670
00:53:30,395 --> 00:53:32,774
Your savages didn't deserve it.

671
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:38,895
Oh, mercy, King! Mercy!

672
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:41,165
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

673
00:53:41,275 --> 00:53:42,441
King!

674
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:44,943
The world is watching.

675
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:47,018
Come on, guys. Let's go, huh?

676
00:53:53,195 --> 00:53:54,195
Yeah.

677
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:09,798
Hello!

678
00:54:12,805 --> 00:54:15,746
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

679
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:25,527
So, this a big mess, huh?

680
00:54:25,692 --> 00:54:28,033
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

681
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:29,510
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in...

682
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:33,209
We cannot talk to Klaue alone.

683
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:42,167
I prefer to talk to Klaue alone for
5 minutes to make a fuss here.

684
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:46,741
After your questioning, we will
take him back to Wakanda with us.

685
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,436
What? No. Look, I like you a lot.

686
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:52,505
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

687
00:54:52,702 --> 00:54:55,969
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor
by letting you even be in here.

688
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:00,711
If touch you again,

689
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:03,438
I'll stick it to your desktop.

690
00:55:04,696 --> 00:55:06,064
Does she speak English?

691
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,969
When she wants to.

692
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:09,855
Huh.

693
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:13,237
I'm going in. And when I'm
done, you guys are up

694
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:15,253
-Agent Ross.
-Yeah?

695
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,643
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

696
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,365
You see that.

697
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:22,291
It's called diplomacy.

698
00:55:23,558 --> 00:55:24,558
You're welcome.

699
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:27,799
-Okoye.
-Ah.

700
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,790
Play nice.

701
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:31,090

No more.

708
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:45,125
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

709
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:46,571
I'm much more your speed.

710
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,434
I don't trust anybody,
not in this work.

711
00:55:48,653 --> 00:55:51,210
But I am interested in is
that arm cannon out there.

712
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,289
Where'd you get that?

713
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:54,392
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

714
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,732
But I can, uh, get you one if you like.

715
00:55:56,859 --> 00:56:00,002
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier and I'll ask them?

716
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:01,583
He's right outside.

717
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,388
Why don't you ask him yourself?

718
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:04,854
What? T'Challa?

719
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:08,717
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

720
00:56:09,013 --> 00:56:10,013
Bingo.

721
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:14,088
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

722
00:56:14,186 --> 00:56:15,432
Um...

723
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:18,719
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

724
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:20,134
<i>It's all a front.</i>

725
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,210
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

726
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,044
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

727
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,280
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America,</i>

728
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,042
<i>but it was in</i>

729
00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:31,556
Africa the whole time.

730
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,490
A technological marvel.

731
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:35,363
All because it was built

732
00:56:35,411 --> 00:56:38,308
on a mound of the most
valuable metal known to man.

733
00:56:38,468 --> 00:56:41,388
Isipho, they called it. The gift.

734
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,188
Vibranium.

735
00:56:43,314 --> 00:56:45,447
Vibranium, yeah, strongest
metal on Earth.

736
00:56:45,537 --> 00:56:46,858
It's not just a metal.

737
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,181
They sew it into their clothes.

738
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:52,270
It powers their city, their tech...

739
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,087
their weapons.

740
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:55,693
Weapons?

741
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:59,322
Yeah. Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

742
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:02,789
That's a nice fairy tale, but
Wakanda is a third world country

743
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:05,486
and you stole all
their vibranium.

744
00:57:05,675 --> 00:57:06,975
I stole...?

745
00:57:10,117 --> 00:57:11,495
All of it?

746
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,522
I took a tiny <i>piece</i> of it.

747
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:17,421
They have a mountain full of it.

748
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,725
<i>They've been mining it for
thousands of years...</i>

749
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:22,032
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

750
00:57:22,183 --> 00:57:24,310
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it

751
00:57:24,366 --> 00:57:26,034
and got out of there alive.

752
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,576
If you don't believe me,
you ask

753
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,278
your friend what his
suit is made of.

754
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,723
What his claws are made of.

755
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,943
Your father told the UN

756
00:57:59,038 --> 00:58:01,310
that Klaue stole all
vibranium you had.

757
00:58:01,405 --> 00:58:03,318
But now, he telling
me you have more?

758
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:07,601
And do you believe the word of an
arms dealer strapped to a chair?

759
00:58:24,988 --> 00:58:26,846
Where is this?

760
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,782
Behind.

761
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:43,657
How much more are you hiding?

762
00:58:44,905 --> 00:58:46,683
Something is happening here behind.

763
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:54,043
Get down!

764
00:58:58,029 --> 00:58:58,854
Whoo!

765
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,118
Get down!

766
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:04,413
Cover!

767
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:11,083
I see you took your
time, didn't you?

768
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:37,952
Nakia.

769
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,584
He just jumped in front of me.

770
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,615
I don't think he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.

771
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,968
Give me a Kimoyo bead.

772
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:59,158
This will stabilize him for now.

773
01:00:07,197 --> 01:00:08,680
Give him to us.

774
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,081
We can save him.

775
01:00:20,073 --> 01:00:22,684
Our mission was
to bring back Klaue.

776
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:24,775
We failed.

777
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:28,379
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

778
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:31,071
How do we justify bringing
him into our borders?

779
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:32,618
He took a bullet for me.

780
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,516
That was his choice.

781
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:37,018
So now we are just
supposed to let him die?

782
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:39,201
Let us consider that we heal him.

783
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,832
It is his duty to report
back to his country.

784
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:45,701
And as king, it is your
duty to protect ours.

785
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,218
I am well aware of
my duties, General.

786
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:51,919
I cannot just let him die...

787
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:54,728
knowing we can save him.

788
01:00:54,964 --> 01:00:57,337
Where exactly are we taking him?

789
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,946
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

790
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,057
It's going to be fun.

791
01:01:17,054 --> 01:01:18,394
He will live.

792
01:01:22,574 --> 01:01:24,053
W'Kabi is here.

793
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:35,719
What's going on brother, huh?
Where is Klaue?

794
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,585
He's not here.

795
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:43,757
He slipped through our hands.

796
01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:46,580
"Slipped"?

797
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:52,245
For 30 years your father was
in power and did nothing.

798
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,635
With you, I thought
it would be different.

799
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:57,442
But it's more of the same.

800
01:02:17,352 --> 01:02:18,951
Let's get going, boss.

801
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:22,366
Do you always sell to the CIA?

802
01:02:22,645 --> 01:02:24,443
I sell to the highest bidder.

803
01:02:24,648 --> 01:02:27,062
But don't you worry. When
I get back to Joburg,

804
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,134
and I lay low for a bit,

805
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,974
I'll make sure both
of you guys get paid.

806
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,547
I'm not even worried
about the money, bro.

807
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:32,842
I know you're good for it.

808
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:35,444
On our way back, just
drop us off in Wakanda.

809
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,554
-You don't want to go there, boy.
-Yeah, I do.

810
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,799
Drop it!

811
01:02:42,076 --> 01:02:45,531
Or your little Bonnie and
Clyde routine ends today.

812
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,062
Put your gun down now!

813
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,913
I'm sorry.

814
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:51,280
-I'm sorry, Erik.
-It's gon' be okay.

815
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:19,900
You...

816
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:22,117
You really want
to go to Wakanda?

817
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:24,669
They're savages.

818
01:03:25,499 --> 01:03:28,794
This is what they do
to people like us.

819
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:30,191
I ain't worried about no brandin'.

820
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:31,626
Check these out.

821
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:34,433
Each one is for a kill.

822
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:37,526
You can scar yourself
as much as you like.

823
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:40,575
To them, you'll just
be an outsider.

824
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:43,329
You're crazy to think that
you could walk in there.

825
01:03:48,835 --> 01:03:52,994
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

826
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:08,353
Leave us!

827
01:04:19,247 --> 01:04:22,747
So your mission
did not go as planned.

828
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,587
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

829
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,028
My father told me
he disappeared.

830
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,677
There was a man today...

831
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:38,434
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

832
01:04:39,924 --> 01:04:42,076
That is not possible.

833
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:46,016
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

834
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:48,270
My grandfather's ring!

835
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:51,448
Do not tell me what is possible.
Tell me the truth!

836
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,544
Some truths...

837
01:05:00,348 --> 01:05:03,990
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

838
01:05:04,948 --> 01:05:07,370
That is not your choice to make.

839
01:05:08,326 --> 01:05:09,420
What happened to him?

840
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,040
I promised the King
to say nothing.

841
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,911
I am your king now!

842
01:05:28,337 --> 01:05:31,274
Your uncle took...

843
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:36,076
a war dog assignment in America.

844
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,196
Your father...

845
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,810
placed me there...

846
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:44,977
to observe.

847
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,013
Unbeknownst to him,

848
01:05:48,246 --> 01:05:51,173
your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

849
01:05:51,703 --> 01:05:53,512
They had a child.

850
01:05:54,306 --> 01:05:57,250
The hardships he saw there...

851
01:05:57,968 --> 01:06:00,101
radicalized your uncle.

852
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,169
I observed for
as long as I could.

853
01:06:03,465 --> 01:06:05,313
Their leaders have
been assassinated.

854
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,868
Communities flooded
with drugs and weapons.

855
01:06:08,037 --> 01:06:10,943
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

856
01:06:11,061 --> 01:06:13,608
All over the planet,
our people suffer

857
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:16,664
because they don't have
the tools to fight back.

858
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,312
With vibranium weapons, they
could overthrow every country

859
01:06:20,368 --> 01:06:23,465
and Wakanda could rule them all
the right way.

860
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:27,643
He knew your father
would not support this.

861
01:06:27,944 --> 01:06:31,248
So your uncle betrayed us.

862
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:32,343
No.

863
01:06:32,415 --> 01:06:36,145
He helped Klaue steal
the vibranium.

864
01:06:37,117 --> 01:06:38,888
No, no, no, no.

865
01:06:39,145 --> 01:06:40,755
You will return home at once

866
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:42,622
where you will face the Council

867
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:45,701
and inform them or your crimes.

868
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:47,663
He drew his weapon on me.

869
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:48,570
No!

870
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:49,920
No!

871
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,893
Your father killed
his own brother...

872
01:07:08,965 --> 01:07:12,932
to save my life.

873
01:07:16,714 --> 01:07:19,965
Speak nothing of this.

874
01:07:24,265 --> 01:07:25,807
And the child?

875
01:07:29,582 --> 01:07:31,116
We left him.

876
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:41,082
We had to...

877
01:07:41,964 --> 01:07:43,202
maintain...

878
01:07:44,535 --> 01:07:45,845
the lie.

879
01:08:11,231 --> 01:08:12,605
What is this?

880
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:14,593
Just a little gift.

881
01:08:37,064 --> 01:08:38,898
Who you are?

882
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:30,387
All right, where am I?

883
01:09:30,922 --> 01:09:33,064
Don't scare me like
that, colonizer!

884
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:35,512
Col--what? My name is Everett.

885
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:37,165
Yes, I know.

886
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:41,781
Everett Ross, former Air Force
pilot and now CIA.

887
01:09:42,217 --> 01:09:43,327
Right.

888
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,503
Okay, is this Wakanda?

889
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,224
No, it's Kansas.

890
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,027
How long ago was Korea?

891
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,226
Yesterday.

892
01:09:57,352 --> 01:09:58,265
I don't think so.

893
01:09:58,314 --> 01:10:00,940
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

894
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:03,207
They do here.

895
01:10:03,372 --> 01:10:06,604
But not by magic, by technology.

896
01:10:10,758 --> 01:10:14,225
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

897
01:10:37,936 --> 01:10:40,336
These train things...

898
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,781
that's magnetic levitation, right?

899
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:44,029
Obviously.

900
01:10:44,148 --> 01:10:48,639
Obviously, but I-I never
seen it this...efficient.

901
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,419
The light panels, what are they?

902
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:54,860
-Sonic stabilizers.
-Sonic what?

903
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:56,521
In its raw form,

904
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:59,789
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported at that speed

905
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:03,511
so I... I developed a way to
temporarily deactivate it.

906
01:11:04,454 --> 01:11:06,041
There's vibranium
on those trains?

907
01:11:06,212 --> 01:11:08,660
There's vibranium all around us.

908
01:11:10,157 --> 01:11:11,805
That's how I healed you.

909
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,320
Where is T'Challa?

910
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:23,510
His Kimoyo beads
have been switched off.

911
01:11:23,663 --> 01:11:25,857
Well, we are not joined
at the hip, Okoye.

912
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:28,848
A man showed up at the border
who claims to have killed Klaue.

913
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:29,775
What?

914
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:32,196
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.

915
01:11:32,235 --> 01:11:34,472
We need to find your brother.

916
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:35,753
An outsider?

917
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:37,419
No, a Wakandan.

918
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,262
He's not a Wakandan.

919
01:11:41,595 --> 01:11:43,129
He's one of ours.

920
01:11:55,856 --> 01:11:57,928
He killed his own brother...

921
01:11:58,089 --> 01:12:00,271
and left a child behind...

922
01:12:00,388 --> 01:12:01,771
with nothing.

923
01:12:03,595 --> 01:12:05,445
What kind of king...?

924
01:12:07,137 --> 01:12:09,240
What kind of man does that?

925
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:11,634
No man is perfect.

926
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:13,802
Not even your father.

927
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:17,228
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

928
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:21,685
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

929
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,459
He may have created
something even worse.

930
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Hey.

931
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:29,656
Look at me.

932
01:12:32,752 --> 01:12:36,654
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

933
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:43,484
<i>You</i> get to decide what kind
of king you are going to be.

934
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,592
Brother, you need
to get here now!

935
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:53,367
Erik Stevens.

936
01:12:53,596 --> 01:12:55,961
Graduated Annapolis, age 19

937
01:12:56,048 --> 01:12:57,977
MIT for grad school.

938
01:12:58,129 --> 01:13:00,454
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan

939
01:13:00,486 --> 01:13:03,503
where he racked up confirmed
kills like it was a video game.

940
01:13:03,673 --> 01:13:05,331
Started calling him Killmonger.

941
01:13:05,419 --> 01:13:08,408
He joined JSOC ghost unit.
Now, these guys are serious.

942
01:13:08,495 --> 01:13:09,773
They will drop off the grid

943
01:13:09,798 --> 01:13:12,955
so they can commit assassinations
and take down governments.

944
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:16,553
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

945
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:18,857
He has a war dog tattoo,

946
01:13:18,913 --> 01:13:21,659
but we have no record of him.

947
01:13:27,951 --> 01:13:30,247
Is this man Wakandan or not?

948
01:13:30,316 --> 01:13:32,857
Tell us what happens.

949
01:13:52,521 --> 01:13:53,521
Speak.

950
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,175
Speak.

951
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,109
I'm staying in your house.

952
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:01,803
Serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium

953
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:03,312
and murdered your people.

954
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,899
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

955
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,409
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

956
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:16,151
Only reason I don't kill
you where you stand

957
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:18,334
is because I know who you are.

958
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:21,245
Now what do you want?

959
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:24,050
I want the throne.

960
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:27,107
Incredible.

961
01:14:29,568 --> 01:14:31,656
Ya'll sittin' up here comfortable.

962
01:14:32,452 --> 01:14:33,961
Must feel good.

963
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:36,548
There's about two billion
people all over the world

964
01:14:36,595 --> 01:14:38,294
that looks like us.

965
01:14:38,365 --> 01:14:40,343
But their lives
are a lot harder.

966
01:14:40,478 --> 01:14:42,673
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate them all.

967
01:14:42,784 --> 01:14:45,578
And what tools are those?

968
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:47,089
Vibranium.

969
01:14:47,676 --> 01:14:48,645
Your weapons.

970
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:52,272
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

971
01:14:52,395 --> 01:14:56,221
It is not our way to be
judge, jury and executioner

972
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,493
for people who are not our own.

973
01:14:58,716 --> 01:15:00,128
Not you own?

974
01:15:00,339 --> 01:15:02,769
But didn't life start right here
on this continent?

975
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,333
So ain't all people your people?

976
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:08,460
I am not king of all people.
I am King of Wakanda.

977
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:10,822
And it is my responsibility

978
01:15:10,941 --> 01:15:13,108
to make sure
our people are safe

979
01:15:13,195 --> 01:15:14,592
and that the vibranium

980
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:17,251
does not fall into the hands
of a person like you.

981
01:15:17,357 --> 01:15:18,420
-Hmm.
-Son.

982
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,977
We have entertained this
charlatan for too long.

983
01:15:21,089 --> 01:15:23,314
Reject his request.

984
01:15:23,504 --> 01:15:25,687
Oh, I ain't requestin' nothin'.

985
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:28,677
-Ask who I am
-You are Erik Stevens.

986
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:31,569
An American black operative.

987
01:15:31,647 --> 01:15:34,537
A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.

988
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,481
That's not my name, princess.

989
01:15:36,586 --> 01:15:37,946
Ask me, King.

990
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:39,141
No.

991
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:41,549
Ask me.

992
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:45,234
Take him away.

993
01:15:46,746 --> 01:15:47,746
Who are you?

994
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,891
I am N'Jadaka.

995
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:52,591
Son of Prince N'Jobu.

996
01:15:53,032 --> 01:15:54,184
Son of N'Jobu?

997
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:56,604
I found my daddy with
panther claws in his chest!

998
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:58,763
You ain't the son of a king.
You're the son of a murderer.

999
01:15:58,865 --> 01:15:59,967
You're lying!

1000
01:16:00,081 --> 01:16:02,455
-Lies!
-I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1001
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:05,935
What?

1002
01:16:07,203 --> 01:16:09,558
The descendant of N'Jobu.

1003
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,161
Hey, Auntie.

1004
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:16,544
I'm exercising my blood right.

1005
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,647
To challenge for the
mantles of king!

1006
01:16:18,822 --> 01:16:20,354
And Black Panther.

1007
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,269
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1008
01:16:26,356 --> 01:16:30,420
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.

1009
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:31,919
He has no rights here!

1010
01:16:31,975 --> 01:16:34,293
The challenge will
take weeks to prepare.

1011
01:16:34,404 --> 01:16:37,249
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1012
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:39,819
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1013
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,370
And somebody to get me
out of these chains.

1014
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:49,176
T'Challa, what do
you know of this?

1015
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:52,829
I accept your challenge.

1016
01:17:10,757 --> 01:17:12,096
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1017
01:17:12,288 --> 01:17:14,605
He should have just come
to the first challenge

1018
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:16,510
and gotten it over with.

1019
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:26,035
The King will now have the
strength of the Black Panther

1020
01:17:26,067 --> 01:17:27,996
stripped away.

1021
01:17:59,352 --> 01:18:00,665
Where is Agent Ross?

1022
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,978
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1023
01:18:08,176 --> 01:18:09,994
This is your last chance.

1024
01:18:11,998 --> 01:18:13,765
Throw down your weapons,

1025
01:18:13,953 --> 01:18:16,694
and we can handle
this another way.

1026
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:27,841
I lived my entire life
waiting for this moment.

1027
01:18:28,034 --> 01:18:31,653
I trained, I lied, I killed

1028
01:18:31,923 --> 01:18:33,496
just to get here.

1029
01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:37,895
I killed in America, Afghanistan,

1030
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,250
Iraq.

1031
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:43,197
I took life

1032
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:45,752
from my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.

1033
01:18:48,297 --> 01:18:49,804
And all this death...

1034
01:18:51,154 --> 01:18:53,230
just so I could kill you.

1035
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:04,127
Let the challenge begin.

1036
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:43,819
Yield!

1037
01:20:05,373 --> 01:20:06,685
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1038
01:20:27,203 --> 01:20:28,417
Come on, get up.

1039
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:30,813
Come here.

1040
01:20:34,236 --> 01:20:35,613
This is for my father.

1041
01:20:36,906 --> 01:20:37,978
Erik!

1042
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:40,637
-Zuri, no.
-Stop!

1043
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,236
-Zuri!
-Zuri, don't!

1044
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:44,355
I am the cause
of your father's death.

1045
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:45,821
Not him.

1046
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:47,722
Take me.

1047
01:20:48,992 --> 01:20:50,714
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

1048
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,404
No!

1049
01:20:52,626 --> 01:20:54,896
No! No!

1050
01:20:55,261 --> 01:20:56,182
No!

1051
01:20:57,424 --> 01:20:58,708
Zuri, no!

1052
01:20:59,894 --> 01:21:00,771
No!

1053
01:21:01,049 --> 01:21:02,565
No! No!

1054
01:21:02,668 --> 01:21:04,398
Zuri! Zuri!

1055
01:21:05,004 --> 01:21:07,028
No! No!

1056
01:21:09,836 --> 01:21:12,362
Is this your king? Huh?

1057
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,689
Is this your king?

1058
01:21:21,985 --> 01:21:25,438
The Black Panther, who's about
to lead you into the future!

1059
01:21:25,559 --> 01:21:26,935
Come on, brother!

1060
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:28,874
Is there nothing that can be done?

1061
01:21:31,157 --> 01:21:32,399
Him?

1062
01:21:32,978 --> 01:21:34,779
He's supposed to protect you?

1063
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:48,247
-No!
-No!

1064
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:57,368
No!

1065
01:22:00,863 --> 01:22:03,122
No. I'm your king.

1066
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,182
-No!
-We have to go now!

1067
01:22:05,269 --> 01:22:07,200
Queen Mother, let's go!

1068
01:22:43,094 --> 01:22:44,967
The Queen Mother and
Shuri, they are safe?

1069
01:22:45,038 --> 01:22:45,872
Yes.

1070
01:22:46,552 --> 01:22:47,852
Thank you.

1071
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:50,539
We should get to them immediately.

1072
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:52,531
I cannot.

1073
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:53,358
What?

1074
01:22:53,441 --> 01:22:54,894
Go, my heart is with you.

1075
01:22:56,354 --> 01:22:58,132
We cannot turn over our nation

1076
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,434
to a man who showed up
here only hours ago.

1077
01:23:00,553 --> 01:23:01,624
He is of royal blood.

1078
01:23:01,654 --> 01:23:04,012
-He killed T'Challa!
-In ritual combat.

1079
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:05,927
Does that really matter?

1080
01:23:08,664 --> 01:23:11,751
You are the greatest
warrior Wakanda has.

1081
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:15,946
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1082
01:23:16,026 --> 01:23:17,326
Overthrow?

1083
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:19,063
Nakia!

1084
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:24,056
I'm not a spy who can
come and go as they so choose.

1085
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:27,227
I am loyal to that throne,

1086
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:29,664
no matter who sits upon it.

1087
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:31,985
What are you loyal to?

1088
01:23:35,323 --> 01:23:36,771
I loved him.

1089
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:40,364
I love my country, too.

1090
01:23:40,592 --> 01:23:42,850
Then you serve your country.

1091
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:46,064
No. I save my country.

1092
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:56,174
What's wrong?

1093
01:23:56,255 --> 01:23:57,880
The King is dead.

1094
01:23:59,098 --> 01:24:01,431
Come with me, unless
you want to join him.

1095
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,479
First Baba.

1096
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:25,564
And now my brother.

1097
01:24:28,223 --> 01:24:30,997
Mama, we didn't even
get to bury him.

1098
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:32,450
Shh.

1099
01:24:38,472 --> 01:24:39,654
-It's me.
-Nakia.

1100
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,464
Who is this man?

1101
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,911
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1102
01:24:44,764 --> 01:24:45,764
Where is Okoye?

1103
01:24:45,854 --> 01:24:47,020
Okoye's not coming.

1104
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:49,824
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1105
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:56,916
Wait here.

1106
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:03,136
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1107
01:25:05,528 --> 01:25:07,790
Allow the heart-shaped herb

1108
01:25:07,864 --> 01:25:10,880
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther

1109
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:13,890
and take you to Ancestral Plane.

1110
01:26:48,817 --> 01:26:51,722
What did I tell you about
going into my things?

1111
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:53,231
Hm?

1112
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:01,334
What did you find?

1113
01:27:02,312 --> 01:27:03,509
Your home.

1114
01:27:05,941 --> 01:27:08,981
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1115
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:14,808
Yes. The sunsets there are
the most beautiful in the world.

1116
01:27:17,285 --> 01:27:19,590
But I fear you still
may not be welcome.

1117
01:27:22,157 --> 01:27:23,184
Why?

1118
01:27:25,482 --> 01:27:26,981
They will say you are lost.

1119
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:29,075
But I'm right here.

1120
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:35,908
No tears for me?

1121
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:41,683
Everybody dies.

1122
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,211
It's just life around here.

1123
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:51,427
Well, look at what I've done.

1124
01:27:53,149 --> 01:27:55,527
I should have taken
you back long ago.

1125
01:27:58,322 --> 01:28:01,073
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1126
01:28:05,966 --> 01:28:08,517
Well, maybe your home is
the one that's lost.

1127
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,906
That's why they can't find us.

1128
01:28:19,858 --> 01:28:22,597
Breathe! Breathe, my King, breathe.

1129
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:24,819
Breathe. Breathe.

1130
01:28:41,787 --> 01:28:43,694
The heart-shaped herb did that?

1131
01:28:46,344 --> 01:28:47,785
-This is all of it?
-Yes.

1132
01:28:47,881 --> 01:28:49,516
So when it comes
time for another king,

1133
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,040
we will be ready.

1134
01:28:51,628 --> 01:28:52,980
Another king?

1135
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:56,847
Yeah, go ahead and
burn all that.

1136
01:28:57,029 --> 01:28:58,738
My King, we cannot do that.

1137
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,897
It is our tradition--

1138
01:29:03,436 --> 01:29:06,722
When I tell you to do something,
I mean that shit.

1139
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:11,863
Burn it all!

1140
01:30:01,172 --> 01:30:02,987
You know, where I'm from,

1141
01:30:03,305 --> 01:30:05,457
when black folks started revolutions,

1142
01:30:05,545 --> 01:30:07,188
they never had the firepower

1143
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,781
or resources to fight
their oppressors.

1144
01:30:10,483 --> 01:30:12,111
Where was Wakanda?

1145
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:15,301
Hm?

1146
01:30:18,082 --> 01:30:19,757
All of that ends today.

1147
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:23,086
We got spies embedded in
every nation on Earth.

1148
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,808
Already in place.

1149
01:30:25,006 --> 01:30:26,692
I know how colonizers think.

1150
01:30:26,771 --> 01:30:29,294
So we're gonna use their
own strategy against them.

1151
01:30:30,099 --> 01:30:32,916
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our war dogs.

1152
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,710
They'll arm oppressed
people all over the world.

1153
01:30:35,926 --> 01:30:38,576
So they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1154
01:30:38,703 --> 01:30:39,956
And their children.

1155
01:30:40,013 --> 01:30:42,117
And anyone else who
takes their side.

1156
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:44,696
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1157
01:30:44,932 --> 01:30:46,485
We're warriors!

1158
01:30:46,777 --> 01:30:48,376
The world's gonna start over,

1159
01:30:48,408 --> 01:30:50,377
and this time, we're on top.

1160
01:30:51,281 --> 01:30:54,802
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1161
01:30:55,618 --> 01:30:58,157
Wakanda has survived for so long

1162
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:01,909
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1163
01:31:02,008 --> 01:31:05,040
Wakanda survived in the
past this way, yes.

1164
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:08,311
But the world is
changing, General.

1165
01:31:08,858 --> 01:31:11,832
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1166
01:31:12,063 --> 01:31:14,102
The outside world
is catching up.

1167
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:16,907
And soon it will
be the conquerors

1168
01:31:17,272 --> 01:31:18,709
or the conquered.

1169
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:22,456
I'd rather be the former.

1170
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:27,475
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1171
01:31:28,961 --> 01:31:30,293
So, where are we going again?

1172
01:31:30,404 --> 01:31:32,952
We are taking the heart-shaped
herb to Jabari land.

1173
01:31:33,057 --> 01:31:34,787
Heart-shaped herb? What is that?

1174
01:31:35,004 --> 01:31:37,528
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1175
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:40,245
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1176
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:42,062
Nakia.

1177
01:31:45,953 --> 01:31:47,679
I don't like this.

1178
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:49,592
The herb belongs to us.

1179
01:31:49,872 --> 01:31:53,603
We may be creating a bigger
monster with M'Baku.

1180
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:01,179
Nakia,

1181
01:32:01,353 --> 01:32:03,337
you should take it yourself.

1182
01:32:03,638 --> 01:32:07,243
I am a spy with no army.

1183
01:32:08,373 --> 01:32:10,261
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1184
01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:13,409
We'll go.

1185
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,184
Oh, boy.

1186
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:23,192
Shh.

1187
01:32:26,554 --> 01:32:27,871
Oh, shit.

1188
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,811
Look down. Stay calm.

1189
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:32,309
Shuri.

1190
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:34,817
Look down.

1191
01:32:36,242 --> 01:32:37,083
Hi.

1192
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:11,693
My son...

1193
01:33:13,275 --> 01:33:16,258
was murdered in ritual combat.

1194
01:33:16,711 --> 01:33:18,751
-Were the odds fair?
-Yes, but--

1195
01:33:18,854 --> 01:33:20,450
So it was less a
murder than a defeat.

1196
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:21,877
Do not rub our noses in it!

1197
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:23,187
Silence!

1198
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:26,084
I make the pronouncements
here, girl.

1199
01:33:26,331 --> 01:33:30,024
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is...

1200
01:33:31,327 --> 01:33:32,557
The new king...

1201
01:33:40,809 --> 01:33:42,907
You cannot talk!

1202
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:46,814
One more word and I will
feed you to my children.

1203
01:33:51,183 --> 01:33:53,635
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1204
01:34:00,475 --> 01:34:03,762
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1205
01:34:06,383 --> 01:34:09,660
This is why we are here.

1206
01:34:10,362 --> 01:34:12,679
To offer this to you.

1207
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,561
An outsider sits on our throne.

1208
01:34:15,872 --> 01:34:18,033
Only you can help us stop him.

1209
01:34:35,435 --> 01:34:36,946
Come with me.

1210
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,186
Impossible!

1211
01:35:00,704 --> 01:35:01,891
Is he breathing?

1212
01:35:01,931 --> 01:35:04,798
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1213
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:08,729
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge of the river border.

1214
01:35:08,848 --> 01:35:10,062
He brought him to me.

1215
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:11,653
Why do you have him in the snow?

1216
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,526
It is the only thing keeping him
from joining the ancestors.

1217
01:35:14,573 --> 01:35:17,065
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1218
01:35:17,149 --> 01:35:19,350
Take him, he'll be
dead in seconds.

1219
01:35:20,509 --> 01:35:22,669
Nakia, the herb.

1220
01:35:39,299 --> 01:35:41,391
I call upon the ancestors.

1221
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:43,483
I call upon Bast.

1222
01:35:43,996 --> 01:35:46,968
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1223
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:49,602
Heal him.

1224
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,137
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1225
01:36:04,326 --> 01:36:05,612
Okay.

1226
01:36:17,682 --> 01:36:18,928
Glory to the ancestors.

1227
01:36:19,102 --> 01:36:20,278
Glory to the ancestors.

1228
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,614
Glory to the ancestors.

1229
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,102
Glory to the ancestors.

1230
01:36:26,164 --> 01:36:27,978
Wake up, T'Challa.

1231
01:36:29,057 --> 01:36:30,441
Wake up.

1232
01:36:32,702 --> 01:36:34,001
My son.

1233
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:41,719
The time has come

1234
01:36:41,846 --> 01:36:43,569
for you to come home

1235
01:36:43,705 --> 01:36:46,060
and be reunited with me.

1236
01:36:57,019 --> 01:36:58,320
Why?

1237
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:03,414
Why didn't you bring
the boy home?

1238
01:37:05,441 --> 01:37:06,741
Why, Baba?

1239
01:37:08,647 --> 01:37:09,663
He...

1240
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,978
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1241
01:37:15,197 --> 01:37:17,785
You were wrong to abandon him.

1242
01:37:17,945 --> 01:37:20,234
I chose my people.

1243
01:37:20,785 --> 01:37:23,015
I chose Wakanda.

1244
01:37:23,525 --> 01:37:25,430
Our future depended

1245
01:37:25,509 --> 01:37:26,940
You were wrong!

1246
01:37:27,144 --> 01:37:29,354
All of you were wrong!

1247
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:33,364
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1248
01:37:35,369 --> 01:37:37,950
We let the fear of discovery

1249
01:37:38,029 --> 01:37:40,456
stop us from doing
what is right.

1250
01:37:41,415 --> 01:37:42,670
No more!

1251
01:37:46,537 --> 01:37:50,396
I cannot stay here with you.

1252
01:37:52,113 --> 01:37:56,389
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1253
01:37:56,863 --> 01:38:00,141
He is a monster
of our own making.

1254
01:38:01,597 --> 01:38:05,131
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1255
01:38:07,011 --> 01:38:09,619
I must right these wrongs.

1256
01:38:20,453 --> 01:38:22,564
Do you have a blanket?

1257
01:38:24,925 --> 01:38:27,930
Killmonger has the full
support of our military.

1258
01:38:28,071 --> 01:38:29,603
And...

1259
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,967
He burned the garden
of the heart-shaped herb.

1260
01:38:33,453 --> 01:38:36,016
Of course he did. That's
what he was trained to do.

1261
01:38:36,439 --> 01:38:40,274
His unit used to work with the CIA
to destabilize foreign countries.

1262
01:38:40,393 --> 01:38:42,449
They would always strike
at transitions of power,

1263
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:44,777
like an election year,
or a death of a monarch.

1264
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:47,313
He got control of
government, the military...

1265
01:38:47,407 --> 01:38:49,444
-Our resources.
-Right.

1266
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:51,691
The Great Mound.

1267
01:38:51,787 --> 01:38:53,707
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1268
01:38:53,771 --> 01:38:56,322
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1269
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:01,793
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1270
01:39:01,857 --> 01:39:03,619
-What?
-What about you?

1271
01:39:04,019 --> 01:39:06,026
The challenge
will have to continue.

1272
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:09,482
T'Challa, we will
not leave Wakanda.

1273
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:11,533
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1274
01:39:11,721 --> 01:39:14,272
If he gets control
of our technology,

1275
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,273
nowhere will be safe.

1276
01:39:36,355 --> 01:39:38,275
The Black Panther lives.

1277
01:39:39,025 --> 01:39:41,082
And when fights for
the fate of Wakanda,

1278
01:39:41,163 --> 01:39:44,023
I will be right there beside him.

1279
01:39:45,066 --> 01:39:46,434
As will I.

1280
01:39:46,807 --> 01:39:48,193
I'm in too.

1281
01:39:49,529 --> 01:39:52,060
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1282
01:39:55,116 --> 01:39:56,581
Are you're done?

1283
01:39:57,715 --> 01:40:00,199
A-Are you-are you-
are you done?

1284
01:40:01,258 --> 01:40:04,709
Could you give me and
Lord M'Baku a moment?

1285
01:40:12,946 --> 01:40:14,199
Thank you.

1286
01:40:14,664 --> 01:40:16,957
I owed you a great debt.

1287
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:19,425
A life for a life.

1288
01:40:19,545 --> 01:40:20,998
Consider it paid.

1289
01:40:21,722 --> 01:40:24,133
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1290
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:27,650
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1291
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,423
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1292
01:40:31,581 --> 01:40:33,327
I bet you could.

1293
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:35,573
But no.

1294
01:40:37,206 --> 01:40:39,976
I will give no Jabari
lives towards your cause.

1295
01:40:40,058 --> 01:40:41,780
It is <i>our</i> cause.

1296
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:44,498
-It's for all of us.
-Us?

1297
01:40:44,697 --> 01:40:48,501
Us? You are the first king to
come here in centuries, and now

1298
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:51,743
you speak of "us"?

1299
01:40:52,473 --> 01:40:55,117
I cannot speak for past kings.

1300
01:40:55,771 --> 01:40:58,572
But an enemy sits on
the throne right now.

1301
01:40:58,874 --> 01:41:01,720
We both know
the power of vibranium.

1302
01:41:02,313 --> 01:41:04,512
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1303
01:41:04,552 --> 01:41:06,520
who do you think
he will come for next?

1304
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,804
We will not help you.

1305
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:47,405
Everything is on schedule.

1306
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:48,675
Have the spies been alerted?

1307
01:41:48,771 --> 01:41:51,143
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1308
01:41:51,294 --> 01:41:53,888
But the war dogs in London,
New York and Hong Kong

1309
01:41:53,913 --> 01:41:55,448
are standing by.

1310
01:41:56,309 --> 01:41:57,881
We'll strike there first.

1311
01:41:57,952 --> 01:41:59,666
The others will come around.

1312
01:42:00,182 --> 01:42:01,255
Look at this.

1313
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,073
A handheld sonic cannon
powerful enough to stop a tank.

1314
01:42:04,145 --> 01:42:06,180
Untraceable by metal detectors.

1315
01:42:06,212 --> 01:42:08,442
And we got thousands of 'em.

1316
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:13,294
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1317
01:42:44,777 --> 01:42:46,384
He lives!

1318
01:42:50,295 --> 01:42:52,162
N'Jadaka!

1319
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:54,522
What's up?

1320
01:42:54,723 --> 01:42:56,706
I never yielded!

1321
01:42:57,188 --> 01:43:00,862
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1322
01:43:01,432 --> 01:43:03,427
All that challenge
shit is over with.

1323
01:43:03,483 --> 01:43:04,801
I'm the king now.

1324
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:07,122
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1325
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:17,254
-Shuri now.
-Copy that.

1326
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:22,218
Go, go, go, go, go!

1327
01:43:22,313 --> 01:43:23,340
Come on, Ross.

1328
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:26,155
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1329
01:43:26,997 --> 01:43:30,531
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1330
01:43:34,136 --> 01:43:35,960
What will we do?

1331
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:37,902
Border Tribe!

1332
01:43:51,915 --> 01:43:53,018
You!

1333
01:43:53,074 --> 01:43:55,505
Your heart is so full of hatred.

1334
01:43:55,592 --> 01:43:57,497
You are not fit to be a king!

1335
01:44:02,172 --> 01:44:02,934
Come on.

1336
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:04,399
Ayo, the King!

1337
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:06,639
Come on!

1338
01:44:19,579 --> 01:44:20,579
Shields!

1339
01:44:55,638 --> 01:44:57,135
W'Kabi, stop this!

1340
01:44:58,273 --> 01:44:59,662
Stop this now!

1341
01:45:03,936 --> 01:45:04,968
No!

1342
01:45:33,055 --> 01:45:35,856
Nakia and I will get control
the Royal Talon with this.

1343
01:45:36,014 --> 01:45:37,324
So, what do I do?

1344
01:45:37,734 --> 01:45:39,353
You'll have to fly it.

1345
01:45:39,655 --> 01:45:41,629
-What?
-You were a great pilot.

1346
01:45:41,716 --> 01:45:43,751
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1347
01:45:43,846 --> 01:45:46,077
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1348
01:45:46,383 --> 01:45:48,280
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1349
01:45:48,559 --> 01:45:50,369
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1350
01:45:50,496 --> 01:45:53,440
-I'm not a Dora.
-Just put it on, it's armor!

1351
01:45:54,905 --> 01:45:55,969
Come!

1352
01:45:58,172 --> 01:45:59,450
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1353
01:45:59,537 --> 01:46:01,288
-Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing
-We're counting on you.

1354
01:46:01,328 --> 01:46:02,510
with this.

1355
01:46:15,158 --> 01:46:16,415
Wakanda forever.

1356
01:46:24,504 --> 01:46:25,504
Come on!

1357
01:46:36,017 --> 01:46:37,036
Go! Go!

1358
01:46:43,219 --> 01:46:45,944
<i>Remote piloting system activated.</i>

1359
01:46:46,946 --> 01:46:47,964
Oh, my God.

1360
01:46:48,054 --> 01:46:51,066
I made it American style for you.
Get in.

1361
01:46:51,484 --> 01:46:52,872
All right.

1362
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,246
Yes!

1363
01:47:02,028 --> 01:47:02,734
Go!

1364
01:47:02,814 --> 01:47:05,378
We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1365
01:47:06,666 --> 01:47:07,967
All right, I'm on it.

1366
01:47:24,914 --> 01:47:26,104
Shut!

1367
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:27,984
Down!

1368
01:47:28,759 --> 01:47:30,260
Take the necklace!

1369
01:47:30,814 --> 01:47:32,270
Take the necklace!

1370
01:47:39,028 --> 01:47:41,117
Wakanda forever!

1371
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:51,447
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1372
01:47:51,534 --> 01:47:53,081
Shoot them down, genius!

1373
01:47:53,169 --> 01:47:54,327
Oh, right.

1374
01:47:55,311 --> 01:47:56,803
Here goes nothin'.

1375
01:48:03,974 --> 01:48:05,172
All right, got 'em.

1376
01:48:09,321 --> 01:48:10,659
Oh, shit.

1377
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:13,178
Shit!

1378
01:49:09,681 --> 01:49:10,681
Shuri!

1379
01:49:15,367 --> 01:49:16,700
What's up, princess?

1380
01:49:16,827 --> 01:49:18,854
You will never be a true king.

1381
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:22,751
Brother!

1382
01:49:54,895 --> 01:49:56,035
Shuri.

1383
01:49:56,773 --> 01:49:57,773
Brother!

1384
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:00,443
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1385
01:50:00,606 --> 01:50:02,550
Stabilizers will
deactivate your suit!

1386
01:50:02,626 --> 01:50:04,021
You won't have protection!

1387
01:50:04,187 --> 01:50:05,473
Neither will he.

1388
01:50:05,596 --> 01:50:06,596
Okay!

1389
01:50:31,018 --> 01:50:32,916
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1390
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:34,515
Your reign is over!

1391
01:50:34,672 --> 01:50:36,545
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1392
01:50:36,624 --> 01:50:40,014
You want to see us become just
like the people you hate so much.

1393
01:50:40,077 --> 01:50:41,847
Divide and conquer
the land it takes.

1394
01:50:41,928 --> 01:50:43,507
No, I've learned from my enemies.

1395
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:46,047
-Beat 'em at their own game.
-You have become them!

1396
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:48,534
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1397
01:50:48,629 --> 01:50:50,230
The world took
everything away from me!

1398
01:50:50,488 --> 01:50:52,047
Everything I ever loved!

1399
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:53,606
But I'ma make sure we're even.

1400
01:50:53,722 --> 01:50:56,948
I'ma track down anyone who would
even think of being loyal to you!

1401
01:50:57,027 --> 01:50:59,400
And I'ma put their ass in the dirt,
right next to Zuri!

1402
01:51:01,402 --> 01:51:02,551
Nakia!

1403
01:51:05,986 --> 01:51:07,827
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay, you?

1404
01:51:07,931 --> 01:51:08,752
Yes.

1405
01:51:08,848 --> 01:51:09,848
Let's go.

1406
01:51:16,754 --> 01:51:19,192
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1407
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,847
What the hell was that?

1408
01:51:22,872 --> 01:51:24,234
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1409
01:51:24,308 --> 01:51:25,179
What? Where?

1410
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:27,048
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1411
01:51:31,399 --> 01:51:33,930
Ross, you have to get
out of there now!

1412
01:51:34,764 --> 01:51:36,042
How long have I got?

1413
01:51:36,868 --> 01:51:39,915
<i>Glass integrity is at 50 percent.</i>

1414
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:41,782
Put me back in.

1415
01:51:41,957 --> 01:51:42,933
Ross!

1416
01:51:43,463 --> 01:51:44,455
Ross!

1417
01:52:02,533 --> 01:52:03,965
Surrender now!

1418
01:52:04,412 --> 01:52:07,258
You have three seconds
to lay down their weapons!

1419
01:52:07,415 --> 01:52:08,380
One!

1420
01:52:09,183 --> 01:52:10,183
Two!

1421
01:52:10,733 --> 01:52:11,606
Thr--

1422
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:23,949
Witness the might of the Jabari
firsthand!

1423
01:53:04,795 --> 01:53:08,066
<i>Glass integrity is at 15 percent.</i>

1424
01:53:16,163 --> 01:53:18,163
<i>-Critical weapons failure.</i>
-Shit!

1425
01:53:23,299 --> 01:53:26,206
Shuri, the last cargo ship
is almost at the border,

1426
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:27,676
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1427
01:53:27,721 --> 01:53:29,231
Make an X with your arms!

1428
01:53:29,877 --> 01:53:31,966
<i>Sonic overload initiated.</i>

1429
01:53:33,190 --> 01:53:34,335
Now, break it.

1430
01:53:43,061 --> 01:53:45,085
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

1431
01:53:45,346 --> 01:53:46,149
<i>Four...</i>

1432
01:53:46,308 --> 01:53:47,155
<i>Three...</i>

1433
01:53:47,401 --> 01:53:48,263
<i>Two...</i>

1434
01:53:48,478 --> 01:53:49,438
<i>One.</i>

1435
01:53:49,893 --> 01:53:51,007
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1436
01:54:03,193 --> 01:54:04,448
Yes! We did it!

1437
01:54:04,839 --> 01:54:07,045
Great! Now get out of there!

1438
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:18,730
Attack!

1439
01:54:38,592 --> 01:54:40,481
Drop your weapon.

1440
01:54:42,348 --> 01:54:44,642
Would you kill me, my love?

1441
01:54:44,806 --> 01:54:46,282
For Wakanda?

1442
01:54:49,669 --> 01:54:51,291
Without question.

1443
01:55:35,252 --> 01:55:36,953
This is it for you, cousin.

1444
01:56:02,473 --> 01:56:03,910
Hell of a move.

1445
01:56:25,036 --> 01:56:28,880
Hell, pops said Wakanda was the
most beautiful he ever seen.

1446
01:56:32,133 --> 01:56:34,545
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1447
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:37,845
Can you believe that?

1448
01:56:38,766 --> 01:56:41,776
Kid from Oakland running around
believing in fairy tales.

1449
01:57:30,153 --> 01:57:31,874
It's beautiful.

1450
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:48,488
Maybe we can still heal you.

1451
01:57:51,128 --> 01:57:52,303
Why?

1452
01:57:54,009 --> 01:57:56,186
So you can just lock me up?

1453
01:57:59,495 --> 01:58:00,740
Nah.

1454
01:58:02,687 --> 01:58:04,507
Just bury me in the ocean...

1455
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,666
with my ancestors that
jumped from the ships.

1456
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:12,307
'Cause they knew death
was better than bondage.

1457
01:59:36,182 --> 01:59:37,313
Thank you.

1458
01:59:39,132 --> 01:59:40,748
You saved me.

1459
01:59:41,472 --> 01:59:43,362
You saved my family.

1460
01:59:46,076 --> 01:59:47,224
Our nation.

1461
01:59:47,388 --> 01:59:49,619
There is nothing to thank me for.

1462
01:59:49,953 --> 01:59:51,397
It is our duty to...

1463
01:59:55,096 --> 01:59:57,858
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1464
01:59:58,944 --> 02:00:00,009
I should have...

1465
02:00:06,796 --> 02:00:08,962
You can't blame me, I almost died.

1466
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:13,632
Stay.

1467
02:00:16,329 --> 02:00:19,658
I think I know a way you can
still fulfill your calling.

1468
02:00:20,854 --> 02:00:22,287
Please stay.

1469
02:00:55,274 --> 02:00:56,848
Ooh, don't lose it!

1470
02:00:57,852 --> 02:00:58,951
Bucket!

1471
02:00:59,144 --> 02:01:00,083
Easy.

1472
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:06,352
When you said you would take me
to California for the first time,

1473
02:01:06,529 --> 02:01:08,439
I thought you meant Coachella

1474
02:01:08,655 --> 02:01:10,126
or Disneyland.

1475
02:01:10,774 --> 02:01:12,143
Why here?

1476
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:18,657
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1477
02:01:24,113 --> 02:01:25,872
They're tearing it down.

1478
02:01:26,949 --> 02:01:27,949
Good.

1479
02:01:28,119 --> 02:01:30,030
They are not tearing it down.

1480
02:01:31,335 --> 02:01:33,103
I bought this building.

1481
02:01:34,965 --> 02:01:36,782
And that building.

1482
02:01:37,698 --> 02:01:39,405
And that one over there.

1483
02:01:40,584 --> 02:01:44,864
This will be the first Wakanda
International Outreach Center.

1484
02:01:45,696 --> 02:01:48,522
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1485
02:01:49,288 --> 02:01:52,905
And you will spearhead the Science
and Information Exchange.

1486
02:01:54,261 --> 02:01:56,631
-You're kidding.
-Yeah?

1487
02:02:05,987 --> 02:02:08,225
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

1488
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:10,407
Man, what the hell is that?

1489
02:02:10,463 --> 02:02:12,157
It's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1490
02:02:12,204 --> 02:02:14,576
It came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1491
02:02:17,852 --> 02:02:18,961
What?

1492
02:02:21,078 --> 02:02:22,078
Check this out, bro.

1493
02:02:22,167 --> 02:02:24,040
Take this back to the house, yo.

1494
02:02:24,583 --> 02:02:26,043
Pull up to school in this.

1495
02:02:26,067 --> 02:02:27,958
Hey, look, we can break it apart,
we can sell it.

1496
02:02:28,061 --> 02:02:29,870
-On eBay.
-I could get a million a piece.

1497
02:02:29,941 --> 02:02:31,387
Ah, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you guys.

1498
02:02:31,427 --> 02:02:32,807
-Where you come from?
-From Wakanda.

1499
02:02:32,892 --> 02:02:34,093
What is a Wakanda?

1500
02:02:34,262 --> 02:02:35,262
Hey, yo!

1501
02:02:35,687 --> 02:02:36,877
This yours?

1502
02:02:40,534 --> 02:02:41,534
Who...

1503
02:02:42,484 --> 02:02:43,719
Who are you?

1504
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:51,779
♪ This may be the night that
my dreams might let me know ♪

1505
02:02:51,928 --> 02:02:53,959
♪ All the stars are closer ♪

1506
02:02:54,253 --> 02:02:56,849
♪ All the stars are closer ♪

1507
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:59,192
United Nations, Vienna, Austria

1508
02:03:08,879 --> 02:03:10,981
My name is King T'Challa.

1509
02:03:11,285 --> 02:03:13,263
Son of King T'Chaka.

1510
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:17,671
I am the sovereign ruler
of the Nation of Wakanda.

1511
02:03:18,126 --> 02:03:20,793
And for the first
time in our history,

1512
02:03:20,965 --> 02:03:24,410
we will be sharing our
knowledge and resources

1513
02:03:24,508 --> 02:03:26,303
with the outside world.

1514
02:03:26,393 --> 02:03:29,803
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1515
02:03:30,073 --> 02:03:31,513
We cannot.

1516
02:03:32,389 --> 02:03:33,774
We must not.

1517
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:36,424
We will work to be an example

1518
02:03:36,456 --> 02:03:39,511
of how we as brothers and
sisters on this Earth

1519
02:03:39,567 --> 02:03:41,571
should treat each other.

1520
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:44,098
Now more than ever...

1521
02:03:44,746 --> 02:03:49,293
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1522
02:03:49,538 --> 02:03:51,491
We all know the truth.

1523
02:03:51,649 --> 02:03:55,054
More connects us
than separates us.

1524
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:56,975
But in times of crisis.

1525
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:59,577
the wise build bridges

1526
02:03:59,662 --> 02:04:02,403
while foolish build barriers.

1527
02:04:02,853 --> 02:04:04,797
We must find a way

1528
02:04:04,876 --> 02:04:07,516
to look after one another

1529
02:04:07,616 --> 02:04:12,114
as if we were one single tribe.

1530
02:04:12,218 --> 02:04:14,289
With all due respect,
King T'Challa,

1531
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:17,694
what can a nation of farmers have
to offer the rest of the world?

1532
02:04:24,738 --> 02:04:26,603
